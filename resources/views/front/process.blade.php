	                    Since we also work across different cultures we prefer to think laterally when it comes to sustainable solutions as we greatly believe in working with low tech to achieve higher impacts.
	                    <br><br>    
	                    Along with that we look into nature and constantly study its ingenious efficiencies and behaviours which we like to bring in our design practice at all levels, at times as a bold structural idea or as spatial flow diagram or as a detail in assembling 1:1 pieces.

	                    Each person within the studio brings their own unique perspective and is encouraged to develop their own interests and research, be it music, philosophy, art or economics, we believe it adds depth to the design process and ultimately reflects in the overall body of work that is produced within the studio.
